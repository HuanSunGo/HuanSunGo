ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @HuanSunGo. I'm currently pursuing the MA of Columbia University in Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences(QMSS) with the focus of Data Science. 


### Facts About Me
ðŸ‘€ Although with a bachelorâ€™s degree in finance and 1.5 years of experience in Investment Banking, I find my true passion is about data and the story it suggests. 

### What Can I Offer
- ðŸ’¬ My coursework focuses on the following topics:
  - Probability and Statistics 
  - Data Structures(Python) and Exploratory Data Analysis(Python, R)
  - Data Visualization (R, Tableau)
  -  Database and Data Warehousing(SQL)
  -  Machine Learning (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, kNN, Decision Tree, Ensembles, RNN, CNN, etc.)
  -  Big Data (AWS, Spark)

- ðŸŒ± With a distinct business sense, I'm more than excited about analyzing and providing interoperation with data itself!
