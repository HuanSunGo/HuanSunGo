- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @HuanSunGo. I'm currently pursuing the MA of Columbia University in Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences(QMSS) with the focus of Data Science. 

- ðŸ‘€ Although with a bachelorâ€™s degree in finance and 1.5 years internship in Investment Banking, I find my true passion is about data and the story it suggests. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m comfortable in Data Analysis in Python, SQL, Tableau, R, and am also actively learning Spark. 
I'm more than excited about analyzing data and providing interoperation with distinct business sense!

- ðŸ“« Iâ€™m actively looking for the 2022 Summer Internship in BA/DA/DSï¼Œand welcome to reach out to me through email or LinkedIn:
